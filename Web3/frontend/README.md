# Frontend Setup for the Web3 Project

This document outlines how to set up and run the frontend of the Web3 project.

## Project Structure

The frontend directory structure includes:

- `public/` - Contains static assets like HTML files, icons, and manifest files.
- `src/` - Contains all the React components and JavaScript code.
  - `App.js`, `App.css` - Main React component and its styling.
  - `Auth/` - Authentication related components.
  - `components/` - Reusable components like buttons, text fields, etc.
  - `contracts/` - Contains ABIs and other contract-related details.
  - `pages/` - Contains page components like Admin Dashboard, Login page, etc.

## Setup

To set up the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Sure, I'll create two separate Markdown (.md) files for the backend and frontend components of your project structure. Each file will include instructions on how to set up and start the respective environment.

# Backend Setup for the Web3 Project

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the backend portion of the Web3 project.

## Project Structure

The backend is structured as follows:

- `app.js` - Entry point of the backend server.
- `controller/` - Contains controller files like `auth.js` for handling authentication.
- `db.js` - Manages database connections.
- `hardhat.config.js` - Configuration for Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum.
- `models/` - Contains Mongoose models like `User.js`.
- `routes/` - Contains route definitions like `auth.js`.
- `validator/` - Contains validation logic for different operations like login, registration, etc.

## Setup

To set up the backend, you need to install the required dependencies first. Make sure you are in the `backend` directory, then run:

```bash
npm install
Running the Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server, typically on http://localhost:3000, unless configured otherwise.

Notes
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine and that you have configured the necessary environment variables, if required.

```
# Running the Frontend
To run the frontend on your local machine, execute:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the React development server, typically accessible via http://localhost:3000.

## Notes
### Ensure that you have Node.js installed and that the backend server is running, as the frontend will need to interact with it for full functionality also Ensure that you have configured the necessary environment variables
